1. Define Item Progession throughout Game4
    -> what is expected to be caught when?
    -> what could be discovered beforehand?

2. Set "Plot walls"
 -> Create logical and game defined barriers keeping players
    seamlessly from progression to far without hindering exploration

3. Limit options to a minimum

        main as fast as possible. 
    -> Spread content throughout time intervalls and Scenes.
